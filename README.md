Your data team has decided to move outside of the consultation business and into creating its own app! After months of brainstorming and market research you finally identify a gap in the market. You pitch the idea for the app "SeeFood". It's Shazam for food. You get funded immediately. Time to get to work!

## Deliverables

* A model that predicts whether a new image is a hot dog or not.
* If time: a prototype Streamlit app where a user can upload a picture. Your app will display whether a Hot Dog is present or not. 
* A very quick presentation. If a streamlit model is not used, make sure your notebook is presentable!
